# Utilities

## Why does this repo exist?
This repository contains light wrappers around ADO.NET to make interacting with sql easier to work with. The project stemmed from a desire to simplify my interactions with Sql Server. It has transformed into trying to discover an easily transferable inferface for working with various sql flavors.

In making use of these SqlHelper, extending the DataReader class was desirable. This stemmed the DataReaderAsync and DataReaderExtensions classes.
